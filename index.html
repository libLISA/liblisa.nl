            libLISA is a tool that can <i>fully automatically</i> scan instruction space, discover instructions and synthesize their semantics.
            It relies on as little human specification as possible:
            specifically, it does not rely on a handwritten (dis)assembler to dictate which instructions are executable on a given CPU, or what their operands are.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We will present libLISA at <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-oopsla#event-overview" target="_blank">OOPSLA'24</a>.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Even though heavily researched, a full formal model of the x86-64 instruction set is still not available.
            This is caused by the sheer complexity of the x86-64 architecture:
            the informal specification found in <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html" target="_blank">Intel manuals is roughly 4700 pages</a>, and even these are known to be <a href="https://stefanheule.com/publications/pldi16-strata/" target="_blank">not trustworthy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifications of CPU architectures often rely heavily on manual work, which is error-prone and labor-intensive.
            The current <a href="https://github.com/kframework/x86-64-semantics" target="_blank">state-of-the-art formal semantics</a> for x86-64 took 8 man-months to write, and even that specification still contains 34 errors (see Section 5.2 of our paper).
        </p>
        <p>
            This situation becomes even more dire when taking into account that different x86-64 machines will behave differently: not only can they have different instruction sets, but behavior is also allowed to be undefined, in which case the same instruction has different behavior on different machines.
        </p>
        <p>
            libLISA aims to solve this problem by using a CPU as the ground truth, and deriving semantics by observing instruction execution.
        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Approach</h2> -->

        <!-- <h2>Architecture Comparison</h2> -->

        <h2>Instruction Semantics</h2>
        <p>
            We analyzed five different architectures: AMD 3900X, AMD 7700X, Intel i9-13900 (p), Intel i9-13900 (e) and Intel Xeon Silver 4110.
        </p>
        <p>
            The semantics can be accessed in the following two ways:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Use <a target="_blank" href="https://explore.liblisa.nl/">explore.liblisa.nl</a> if you want to browse the semantics manually.</li>
                <li>Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/libLISA/liblisa/tree/main/cli/liblisa-semantics-tool"><tt>liblisa-semantics-tool</tt></a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://crates.io/crates/liblisa">the <tt>liblisa</tt> Rust crate</a> if you want to use the semantics programmatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
